YouTube Vanced+ fan-made source code

Due to big ReVanced and other community on Reddit, Discord, YouTube,etc.. so app name must be changed to "YouTube Vanced+" instead of "YouTube Vanced"

We are continuing learning how to code with Kotlin/Java just by YouTube tutorial for beginners so don't expect for patches now!

This commit is 2nd commit that modified README.md, next commit should be is code changes
